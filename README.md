Developed an SMS Spam Classifier using Python and Streamlit. Implemented text preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal. 
Utilized machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and evaluated multiple models to achieve optimal performance.
The frontend was built with Streamlit, providing an interactive interface for real-time classification. 
The project also involved vectorization of text data using TF-IDF and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy and precision.
